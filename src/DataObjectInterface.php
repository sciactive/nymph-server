   * - name - The name of the object.
   * - type - The type of data this object represents. (E.g., "user",
   *   "customer", "page".) This can be localized.
   * - types - The same as above, but pluralized. (E.g., "users".)
   * - url_view - The URL where this object can be viewed. If the currently
   *   logged in user doesn't have the ability to view it, or there is no URL
   *   to view it, this should return null.
   * - url_edit - The same as above, but for editing.
   * - url_list - The URL where this object, and others like it, can be found.
   *   (E.g., to a list of users.)
   * - icon - The class to apply for an icon representing this object.
   *   (Generally a Font Awesome or Bootstrap class.)
   * - image - The URL to an image representing this object.
   *
   * @param string $type The type of information being requested.
   * @return mixed The information, or null if the information doesn't exist or
   *               can't be returned.
